# Optimal UAV Placement and Communication

This repo contains the code for the project Optimal UAV Placement and Communication. MATLAB version used: `R2020b`.

The final version of the paper can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9530098), which was accepted at the 2021 National Conference on Communications (NCC). A copy has been added to the repo. Please note that the code from the paper is present in the folder titled `convex_optimization_based_uav_placement`. The other folder was an exploration.
